def fix_bad_unicode(text):
    u"""
    Something you will find all over the place, in real-world text, is text
    that's mistakenly encoded as utf-8, decoded in some ugly format like
    latin-1 or even Windows codepage 1252, and encoded as utf-8 again.

    This causes your perfectly good Unicode-aware code to end up with garbage
    text because someone else (or maybe "someone else") made a mistake.

    This function looks for the evidence of that having happened and fixes it.
    It searches for the nonsense character sequences that are incorrect latin-1
    representations of all UTF-8 characters in the Basic Multilingual Plane,
    and replaces them with the Unicode character they were clearly meant to
    represent.

    The input to the function must be Unicode. It's not going to try to
    auto-decode bytes for you -- then it would just create the problems it's
    supposed to fix.

        >>> print fix_bad_unicode(u'Ãºnico')
        único

        >>> print fix_bad_unicode(u'This text is fine already :þ')
        This text is fine already :þ

    Because these characters often come from Microsoft products, we also allow
    for the possibility that we get not just Unicode characters 128-255, but
    also Windows's conflicting idea of what characters 128-160 are. However,
    because some pairs of these characters are actually useful, we only correct
    them in sets of three or more.

        >>> print fix_bad_unicode(u'This â€” should be an em dash')
        This — should be an em dash

    We might have to deal with both Windows characters and raw control
    characters at the same time, especially when dealing with characters like
    \x81 that have no mapping in Windows.

        >>> print fix_bad_unicode(u'This text is sad .â\x81”.')
        This text is sad .⁔.

    This function even fixes multiple levels of badness:

        >>> wtf = u'\xc3\xa0\xc2\xb2\xc2\xa0_\xc3\xa0\xc2\xb2\xc2\xa0'
        >>> print fix_bad_unicode(wtf)
        ಠ_ಠ

    However, it has safeguards against sequences of letters and punctuation
    that can occur in valid text:

        >>> print fix_bad_unicode(u'“I’m not such a fan of Charlotte Brontë…”')
        “I’m not such a fan of Charlotte Brontë…”

        >>> print fix_bad_unicode(u'ÅHÅ™, the new couch from IKEA')
        ÅHÅ™, the new couch from IKEA
