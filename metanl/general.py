    Splits apart words that are written in CamelCase.

    Bugs:

    - Non-ASCII characters are treated as lowercase letters, even if they are
      actually capital letters.

    Examples:

    >>> un_camel_case('1984ZXSpectrumGames')
    '1984 ZX Spectrum Games'

    >>> un_camel_case('aaAa aaAaA 0aA  AAAa!AAA')
    'aa Aa aa Aa A 0a A AA Aa! AAA'

    >>> un_camel_case('MotÃ¶rHead')
    'Mot\xf6r Head'

    >>> un_camel_case('MSWindows3.11ForWorkgroups')
    'MS Windows 3.11 For Workgroups'

    This should not significantly affect text that is not camel-cased:

    >>> un_camel_case('ACM_Computing_Classification_System')
    'ACM Computing Classification System'

    >>> un_camel_case('Anne_Blunt,_15th_Baroness_Wentworth')
    'Anne Blunt, 15th Baroness Wentworth'

    >>> un_camel_case('Hindi-Urdu')
    'Hindi-Urdu'
